I'm starting to think that creating a blog might be a good idea.  I'm not entirely sure what I will include in the blog.  But I think that it could be worth while to have a place to store ideas and snippets of interesting things.  This could be the place.

```{r testr}
adf <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3,4), b=c(9,8,7,6))
knitr::kable(adf)
```
